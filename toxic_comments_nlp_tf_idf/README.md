## Project
Preprocess tweets using lemmatization and implement TF-IDF.
## Description
Online store "Wikishop" launches a new service. Now users can edit and supplement product descriptions, just like in wiki communities. 
That is, clients propose their edits and comment on the changes of others. 
The store needs a tool that will look for toxic comments and submit them for moderation.
## Aim
Develop a prediction method.
## Evaluation metric
The successful machine learning model should predict with f1-score > 0.75.
