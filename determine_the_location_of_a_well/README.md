## Project
Based on provided oil samples in three regions, one should determine the location of a well.
## Description
The characteristics for each well in the region are already known.
The steps for choosing a location:
1) Characteristics for wells are collected in the selected region: oil quality and volume of its reserves;
2) Build a model to predict the volume of reserves in new wells;
3) Choose the wells with the highest value estimates;
4) The region with the maximum total profit of the selected wells is determined.
## Aim
Determine the location of a well.
## Evaluation metric
Build a model to determine the region where mining will bring the most profit. Analyze possible profits and risks using the Bootstrap technique.
